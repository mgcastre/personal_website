      <h2>Short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a hydrologist and water resources engineer currently pursuing a PhD in hydroinformatics. I apply the latest technologies to simulate how water moves through nature and understand how humans can interact with it in a more sustainable way. I build numerical models and web-based tools such as interactive maps and dashboards to communicate modeling results to water managers and other stakeholders. I am researching the next generation of AI-based digital tools that will help decision-makers solve the most pressing water chellenges of the 21st century.
        <br><br> 
        My current research focuses on the development of decision-support frameworks based on hybrid models (physically-based + data-driven) to optimize the water quality of inland water bodies (rivers, canals and lakes) and coastal areas. I am also interested in projects that harness the potential of remote sensing and computer vision to build hydrological and water quality models for poorly gauged or ungauged basins.
        <br><br> 
        In addition, I am an amateur videographer/photographer and drone enthusiast who enjoys capturing aerial footage of rivers, lakes and coastal areas. As an advocate of using video as a medium for science communication, I aspire to combine my passions (scientific research, teaching and video production) to someday produce a documentary film about water, nature and people.
