      <p>
        I am a hydrologist and hydroinformatics expert. I apply the latest technologies to simulate how water moves through nature and understand how humans can interact with it in a more sustainable way.

        I am interested in projects that combine remote sensing and computer vision with hydrological modeling, as well as the development of hybrid simulations (physically-based + data-driven) and interactive web dashboards as tools for water management.
