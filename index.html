          <p>
            I am a hydrologist and water resources engineer specialized in hydroinformatics. I apply the latest technologies to simulate how water moves through nature and understand how humans can interact with it in a more sustainable way. I build tools such as interactive maps and web dashboards that help in the decision-making process for water management.
            <br><br> My current research focuses on the development of hybrid approaches (physically-based + data-driven) to simulate phenomena such as saltwater intrusion in coastal lakes and estuaries, among other environmental fluid mechanics applications. I am also interested in projects that harness the potential of remote sensing and computer vision to build hydrological and water quality models for poorly gauged or ungauged basins
            <br><br> In addition, I am an amateur videographer/photographer and drone enthusiast who enjoys capturing aerial footage of rivers, lakes and coastal areas. As an advocate of using video as a medium for science communication, I aspire to combine my passions (scientific research, teaching and video production) to someday produce a documentary film about water, nature and people.
